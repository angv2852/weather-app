Vanilla Weather App

This project was created during the SheCodes Plus workshop. It was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and VS Code. It involved designing a wireframe for the app, adding HTML & CSS, then using the AJAX method to retrieve data from the Open Weather API and geolocation API to return live weather data. Using JavaScript functions, I was able to produce a live app with real data to display the current weather, as well as a 6 day forecast. It's open-sourced using Github and hosted on Netlify.
